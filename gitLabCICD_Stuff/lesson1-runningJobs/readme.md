learn abotu gitlab which I feel is centered on CICd processes and how its different to guthub.
used  yaml files committed changes and then executed runners. had to create a runner before hand trhough the gui interface. looked into Yaml syntax which reminded me of Terraform hcl language a little. i.e reserved keywords such as stages to declare build pipelines and artifacts as outputs of one script to be used by another , variables whic are used globally and general linux stuff. used docker images to build and went into pipelines/jobs to see logs.
