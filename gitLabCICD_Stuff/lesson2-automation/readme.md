here i first installed dependencies on local and then ran it. always such a cumbersome processs that hogs memory because node modules.really liked seeing how to automate this process on gitlab with the yaml file. cool using docker image to know about the relative command.
played around with the automation concept by adding stages i.e one stage depends on another to the yaml file and running additional commands like test commands inside the prject folder and node commmands with yarn see the yaml file
