hosted a website on s3. configured an Iam role with and assigned access key and plugged it in as environment variables into cicd pipelines. used docker image of aws cli to programmatically access s3 resource with inline bash script using a sync command . began incorporating several staging environments into the same yaml script using yaml Rules to determine if the block should be run if an d only if cur branch is main. next step is to divide the environments to thier own concern and then adding for each stage an enviroment scope so they use thier associated environment variables.
