so this file simply creates a portfolio and a product with terraform on aws service catalog.

todo:
understand how  aws-service catalog works. I have created a template but do now know how to use it.
i.e i can see the administrator side but not the user side.

once that is understood. then I have gone through a very basic runthrough of the entier pipeline with aws service catalog.
that is from the admin and the user side eac of whci have thier own steps to go through.

the next step will be to look ath the entire pipeline of AWS ACCOUNT FACTORY W. Terraform. I will have only broken down one part of this which is the above.

there is a preliminary step which is more complex. it is a singular terraform module containtning 4 repositories. each repo will have a specific function. the idea is to focus on one of these repos of the module which will be account request. 
and then figure out that pipeline which have to use codecommit, code build and dynamodb. never used aws codecommit/build so yeah.

if I can pull the above block off then I would have two very rough parts of the ENTIRE Pipeline down. 








okay so the function works as intended. all i need to happen now is that i need an event bridge to trigger the lambda at 18.00 pm and for an sns topic to be subscribed to send a text message of the return value of the lambda code

Edit
Excellent! I'm glad the function is working as intended. Now, let's set up EventBridge to trigger the Lambda function daily at 18:00 PM and configure an SNS topic to send the Lambda's return value as a text message. Here's how to do it step by step:

Create an SNS Topic: a. Go to the Amazon SNS console. b. Click "Create topic". c. Choose "Standard" type. d. Name it something like "LambdaResultNotification". e. Create the topic and note down the ARN.
Subscribe to the SNS Topic: a. In the SNS topic details, click "Create subscription". b. Choose "SMS" as the protocol. c. Enter your phone number in the international format (e.g., +1XXXXXXXXXX). d. Click "Create subscription".
Modify Lambda Function: Update your Lambda function to publish to the SNS topic:
python

Copy
import json
import requests
import logging
import boto3

logger = logging.getLogger()
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

sns_client = boto3.client('sns')
SNS_TOPIC_ARN = 'arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:LambdaResultNotification'  # Replace with your actual ARN

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    logger.info("Lambda function started")
    try:
        logger.info("Making API request")
        response = requests.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
        logger.info(f"API request completed with status code: {response.status_code}")
        
        if response.status_code == 200:
            data = response.json()
            result = f'Successfully fetched data: {data}'
        else:
            result = f'API request failed with status code: {response.status_code}'
        
        # Publish to SNS
        sns_response = sns_client.publish(
            TopicArn=SNS_TOPIC_ARN,
            Message=result,
            Subject='Lambda Function Result'
        )
        logger.info(f"Message published to SNS: {sns_response}")
        
        return {
            'statusCode': 200,
            'body': json.dumps(result)
        }
    except Exception as e:
        error_message = f'An error occurred: {str(e)}'
        logger.error(error_message)
        
        # Publish error to SNS
        sns_client.publish(
            TopicArn=SNS_TOPIC_ARN,
            Message=error_message,
            Subject='Lambda Function Error'
        )
        
        return {
            'statusCode': 500,
            'body': json.dumps(error_message)
        }
Update Lambda Execution Role: a. Go to the IAM console. b. Find the role associated with your Lambda function. c. Add the AmazonSNSFullAccess policy (or create a custom policy with just the sns:Publish permission for your specific topic).
Create an EventBridge Rule: a. Go to the Amazon EventBridge console. b. Click "Create rule". c. Give it a name like "DailyLambdaTrigger". d. For the rule type, choose "Schedule". e. In the schedule pattern, choose "Cron expression" and enter: 0 18 * * ? * (This runs at 18:00 UTC every day. Adjust the time zone if needed.) f. In the "Select targets" section, choose your Lambda function. g. Click "Create".
Now, your setup should work as follows:

Every day at 18:00, EventBridge will trigger your Lambda function.
The Lambda function will make the API call and process the result.
The result (or any error message) will be published to the SNS topic.
You'll receive an SMS with the Lambda function's result.
Remember to replace SNS_TOPIC_ARN in the Lambda code with your actual SNS topic ARN.

Also, keep in mind that SMS messaging via SNS may incur costs, and there might be daily limits on the number of SMS messages you can send, depending on your AWS account status.

Is there anything else you'd like me to clarify or help with regarding this setup?
