To use this setup:

Package your Lambda function into a ZIP file named lambda_function.zip.
Apply the Terraform configuration to create the Lambda function and associated resources.
You can then invoke the Lambda function with different playbook names as needed.

To trigger the Lambda function and run a specific playbook, you can use the AWS CLI, SDK, or another AWS service like EventBridge for scheduling. Here's an example using AWS CLI:
bashCopyaws lambda invoke --function-name ecs-ansible-task-trigger --payload '{"playbook": "custom_playbook.yml"}' output.txt
